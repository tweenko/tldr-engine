# Welcome to tlDR[^1] v0.9.0 (BETA)

This engine is quite simple to use, but in case you have any questions, 
please ask them in [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/x3t8JTyC2p). 
Something important, too. This engine is still very much under semi-active development! 
If you want to request a feature or want me to change something, you may put that 
request in the according channel in the server mentioned above.

> Before doing anything though, I want to discourage you from making any changes 
to the things inside the @engine folder, because it is likely they may change over 
time and your code may break when pulling a new version. 
Be careful about changing source code!

There is no straight up documentation per se, (at least for now) so the Discord server can be considered a very interactive documentation, if you will.
