# Welcome to tlDR[^1] Engine v0.7.8 (BETA)

This engine is quite simple to use, but in case you have any questions, 
please ask them in [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/x3t8JTyC2p).

There is no straight up documentation per se, (at least for now) so the Discord server can be considered a very interactive documentation, if you will.

### Credits and Thanks
- The Soul and Box system originally created by **Callum** (jevilhumor)
- Character faces are ripped from [**Kristal**](https://kristal.cc/), and their names are as well. 
Huge shout-out! The Kristal Engine is really good if you're into lua, so consider it too!
- The Anime Library was made by [futuregamer25](https://futuregamer25.github.io/) (It's really good. Thanks a lot!)
- Some code in the engine was made by **doedreemurr**.
- Small contributions from other people, as well!
