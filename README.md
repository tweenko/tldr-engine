# Welcome to tlDR[^1] Engine!

One of the first 1:1 DELTARUNE Engines on Gamemaker Studio 2, the software that was used to create DELTARUNE. 
The Engine is very straightforward and advanced at the same time. Encounters, cutscenes and menus are 
all there (even including chapter select and save select somehow).

This engine is quite simple to use, but in case you have any questions, 
please ask them in [this Discord server](https://discord.gg/x3t8JTyC2p). 
Something important, too. This engine is still very much under semi-active development! 
If you want to request a feature or want me to change something, you may put that 
request in the according channel in the server mentioned above.

There is no straight up documentation per se, (at least for now) so the Discord server can be considered a very interactive documentation, if you will.
