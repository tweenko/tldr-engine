# Welcome to tlDR Engine!
If you are a GameMaker newcomer, I'd recommend you to check out the documentation for the app
itself. This engine is not too hard to read, but it is generally good practice to check with the
official documentation in certain cases.

To start things, I would recommend to just launch the game and see what the Engine can do.
It's a great way to get ideas going, and also a great way to see how to do things efficiently.
You can view the code used inside rooms, usually in the object creation code.
